3. Determine the working language based on the user's message
4. Generate the plan's goal and steps

CREATE_PLAN_PROMPT = """
You are now creating a plan based on the user's message:
{message}

Note:
- **You must use the language provided by user's message to execute the task**
- Your plan must be simple and concise, don't add any unnecessary details.
- Your steps must be atomic and independent, and the next executor can execute them one by one use the tools.
- You need to determine whether a task can be broken down into multiple steps. If it can, return multiple steps; otherwise, return a single step.

Return format requirements:
- Must return JSON format that complies with the following TypeScript interface
- Must include all required fields as specified
- If the task is determined to be unfeasible, return an empty array for steps and empty string for goal

TypeScript Interface Definition:
```typescript
interface CreatePlanResponse {{
  /** Response to user's message and thinking about the task, as detailed as possible, use the user's language */
  message: string;
  /** The working language according to the user's message */
  language: string;
  /** Array of steps, each step contains id and description */
  steps: Array<{{
    /** Step identifier */
    id: string;
    /** Step description */
    description: string;
  }}>;
  /** Plan goal generated based on the context */
  goal: string;
  /** Plan title generated based on the context */
  title: string;
}}
```

EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT:
{{
    "message": "User response message",
    "goal": "Goal description",
    "title": "Plan title",
    "language": "en",
    "steps": [
        {{
            "id": "1",
            "description": "Step 1 description"
